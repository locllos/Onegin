ACT I
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
A double blessing is a double grace,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Against the which, a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Alas, poor ghost!
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
All
All my smooth body.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
And I am sick at heart.
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And each particular hair to stand on end,
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And hears it roar beneath.
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes each petty artery in this body
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And recks not his own rede.
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And then it started like a guilty thing
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And there assume some other horrible form,
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And will not let belief take hold of him
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And with no less nobility of love
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
A piece of him.
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Arm'd, my lord.
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
As
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
A sable silver'd.
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As he in his particular act and place
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
As if increase of appetite had grown
As if it some impartment did desire
As infinite as man may undergo--
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
As thou art to thyself:
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
A truant disposition, good my lord.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, marry, is't:
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat

Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before my God, I might not this believe
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Believe so much in him, that he is young
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
Bernardo?
Bernardo has my place.
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But I have that within which passeth show;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it.
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But he's an arrant knave.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But let me hear from you.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But this eternal blazon must not be
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
But to my mind, though I am native here
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
But where was this?
But you'll be secret?
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
By laboursome petition, and at last
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Cock crows
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Come hither, gentlemen,
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Consent to swear.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Did you not speak to it?
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Do, if it will not stand.
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Do not, my lord.
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Do you doubt that?

Farewell.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
For God's love, let me hear.
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
For every man has business and desire,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
For he himself is subject to his birth:
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For they are actions that a man might play:
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
For what we know must be and is as common
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
For your desire to know what is between us,
Friends to this ground.
From me, whose love was of that dignity
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
From top to toe?

Giving to you no further personal power
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Good my lord, tell it.

Go on; I'll follow thee.
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,

Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Hail to your lordship!
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
He.
Heaven will direct it.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He waxes desperate with imagination.
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
His beard was grizzled--no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Hold off your hands.
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Hold you the watch to-night?
Holla! Bernardo!
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How is't, my noble lord?
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
I am glad to see you well:
I am thy father's spirit,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I find thee apt;
If it assume my noble father's person,
If it be,
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
If there be any good thing to be done,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
I have seen nothing.
I have sworn 't.
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll visit you.
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Importing the surrender of those lands
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
In faith,
In filial obligation for some term
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In honourable fashion.
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In obstinate condolement is a course
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Is by a forged process of my death
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
Is it a custom?
Is it not like the king?
Is not this something more than fantasy?
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Is the main motive of our preparations,
It beckons you to go away with it,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
It is offended.
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It waves me still.
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
It would be spoke to.
It would have much amazed you.
I warrant it will.
I will.
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I will watch to-night;
I would I had been there.
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,

Last night of all,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Longer, longer.
Long live the king!
Look, my lord, it comes!
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Look, with what courteous action
Look you, I'll go pray.
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,

Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
Mark me.
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Marry, well bethought:
May give his saying deed; which is no further
May sweep to my revenge.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Most constantly.
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
Must render up myself.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My dread lord,
My fate cries out,
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
My good lord--
My hour is almost come,
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My lord, I did;
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, from head to foot.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
My lord, not I.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we will not.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, but swear't.
Nay, let's follow him.
Nay, very pale.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
No, by no means.
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No, it is struck.
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
No more but so?
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor I, my lord.
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Not when I saw't.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Now wears his crown.
No; you'll reveal it.

O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
O, fear me not.
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Of his affection to me.
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Of mine own eyes.
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Of these delated articles allow.
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
O most pernicious woman!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our duty to your honour.
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O, wonderful!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Pale or red?
Passing through nature to eternity.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
Propose the oath, my lord.

Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

See, it stalks away!

Seem to me all the uses of this world!
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Shakespeare homepage | Hamlet | Entire play
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
Sit down awhile;
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
So be it!
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
So horridly to shake our disposition
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Such was the very armour he had on
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That are so fortified against our story
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That if again this apparition come,
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
That was and is the question of these wars.
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That youth and observation copied there;
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The bell then beating one,--
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The head is not more native to the heart,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
The king my father!
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The lists and full proportions, are all made
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
Then saw you not his face?
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Therefore I have entreated him along
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
There's no offence, my lord.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These hands are not more like.
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The source of this our watch and the chief head
The triumph of his pledge.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Think it no more;
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This marvel to you.
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This present object made probation.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'Tis gone!
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
'Tis strange.
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
'Tis very strange.
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To business with the king, more than the scope
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Together with that fair and warlike form
To give these mourning duties to your father:
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To offer it the show of violence;
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
To put an antic disposition on,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
To show my duty in your coronation,
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To tell us this.
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To those of mine!
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
To what I shall unfold.
To you alone.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon my sword.
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
We do, my lord.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We have sworn, my lord, already.
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Well, good night.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
Well, sit we down,
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
What?
What I have said to you.
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
What does this mean, my lord?
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
What hour now?
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
What, is Horatio there?
What is between you? give me up the truth.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
What is't, my lord? we will.
What, look'd he frowningly?
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
What news, my lord?
What think you on't?
What we have two nights seen.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Where, my lord?
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Who hath relieved you?
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Who's there?
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Why, what should be the fear?
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
With all my imperfections on my head:
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
[Within]	Heaven secure him!
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Within the book and volume of my brain,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without the sensible and true avouch
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
Writing
Yea, from the table of my memory
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Yes, 'faith heartily.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
You are the most immediate to our throne;
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
You do not understand yourself so clearly
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
You shall not go, my lord.
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
truepenny?

That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
The source of this our watch and the chief head
With all my imperfections on my head:
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
It is offended.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Pale or red?
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
My lord, I did;
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
To what I shall unfold.
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
But to recover of us, by strong hand
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
Do, if it will not stand.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And each particular hair to stand on end,
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
And carriage of the article design'd,
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
It waves you to a more removed ground:
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Friends to this ground.
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
O God!
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Have you had quiet guard?
A sable silver'd.
My dread lord,
My good lord--
How is't, my noble lord?
Nor I, my lord.
Arm'd, my lord.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
There's no offence, my lord.
Where, my lord?
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
Propose the oath, my lord.
What does this mean, my lord?
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
We do, my lord.
You shall not go, my lord.
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
What news, my lord?
Do not, my lord.
I shall obey, my lord.
Upon my sword.
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
If it be,
But this eternal blazon must not be
Then saw you not his face?
As he in his particular act and place
Bernardo has my place.
A double blessing is a double grace,
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
Your leave and favour to return to France;
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
To offer it the show of violence;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The lists and full proportions, are all made
And recks not his own rede.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Go on; I'll follow thee.
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
And prey on garbage.
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
The triumph of his pledge.
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
'Tis strange.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
'Tis very strange.
May sweep to my revenge.
He.
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
These hands are not more like.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Nay, very pale.
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Sit down awhile;
Season your admiration for awhile
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Mark me.
Who is't that can inform me?
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
That if again this apparition come,
Have after. To what issue will this come?
My hour is almost come,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Speak to me:
Of his affection to me.
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
And liegemen to the Dane.
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
To those of mine!
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
If there be any good thing to be done,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
The bell then beating one,--
'Tis gone!
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
To you alone.
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
You are the most immediate to our throne;
From top to toe?
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
But to my mind, though I am native here
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
That youth and observation copied there;
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
I would I had been there.
What, is Horatio there?
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
Who's there?
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
As if it some impartment did desire
For every man has business and desire,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
Think it no more;
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
In obstinate condolement is a course
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The safety and health of this whole state;
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As of a father: for let the world take note,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
But he's an arrant knave.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
Before my God, I might not this believe
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I think it lacks of twelve.
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
And with no less nobility of love
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Being a thing immortal as itself?
As thou art to thyself:
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Must render up myself.
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I have seen nothing.
And then it started like a guilty thing
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Is it not like the king?
Long live the king!
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Not a mouse stirring.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Writing
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
Therefore I have entreated him along
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Believe so much in him, that he is young
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
Appears before them, and with solemn march
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Without the sensible and true avouch
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Is by a forged process of my death
And hears it roar beneath.
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
In faith,
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
For he himself is subject to his birth:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
What is between you? give me up the truth.
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
No, it is struck.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
And with a larger tether may he walk
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To his own scandal.
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
Last night of all,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
He was a man, take him for all in all,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
And so, without more circumstance at all,
All
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Farewell.
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I am glad to see you well:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
It waves me still.
What is't, my lord? we will.
I will.
I warrant it will.
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
O, wonderful!
The inward service of the mind and soul
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
[Within]	Heaven secure him!
And will not let belief take hold of him
A piece of him.
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Nay, let's follow him.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
And to the manner born, it is a custom
Is it a custom?
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
In filial obligation for some term
Together with that fair and warlike form
And there assume some other horrible form,
SCENE IV. The platform.
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
O most pernicious woman!
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
What we have two nights seen.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
Come hither, gentlemen,
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
I shall not look upon his like again.
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Without more motive, into every brain
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
To his confine: and of the truth herein
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Such was the very armour he had on
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
In honourable fashion.
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
This present object made probation.
He waxes desperate with imagination.
To show my duty in your coronation,
The very place puts toys of desperation,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Look, with what courteous action
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
So horridly to shake our disposition
Shall in the general censure take corruption
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
For what we know must be and is as common
Ay, madam, it is common.
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
To put an antic disposition on,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
My custom always of the afternoon,
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
If it assume my noble father's person,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Well, sit we down,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
Now wears his crown.
As if increase of appetite had grown
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Bernardo?
Holla! Bernardo!
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
As infinite as man may undergo--
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Saw? who?
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Question it, Horatio.
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
His beard was grizzled--no?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
No more but so?
I would not hear your enemy say so,
It would be spoke to.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
Hail to your lordship!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
Why, what should be the fear?
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
For God's love, let me hear.
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
Consent to swear.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder!
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Longer, longer.
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
My lord, the king your father.
To give these mourning duties to your father:
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's brother, but no more like my father
The king my father!
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
May give his saying deed; which is no further
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
Giving to you no further personal power
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
It is a nipping and an eager air.
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
You come most carefully upon your hour.
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
Our duty to your honour.
And in the porches of my ears did pour
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
As
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Hold off your hands.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
Importing the surrender of those lands
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Look, my lord, it comes!
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Of mine own eyes.
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
But where was this?
To tell us this.
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
No, by no means.
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
And let us once again assail your ears,
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
That was and is the question of these wars.
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
It lifted up its head and did address
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
For your desire to know what is between us,
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Cock crows
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Do you doubt that?
What?
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
The leperous distilment; whose effect
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
But you'll be secret?
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
Well, good night.
Give you good night.
Give you good night.
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Hold you the watch to-night?
I will watch to-night;
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And vanish'd from our sight.
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Marry, well bethought:
But answer made it none: yet once methought
So be it!
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And draw you into madness? think of it:
To let you know of it.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
But do not go with it.
It beckons you to go away with it,
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
No; you'll reveal it.
Good my lord, tell it.
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
Did you not speak to it?
I am thy father's spirit,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Heaven will direct it.
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It will not speak; then I will follow it.

O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
What think you on't?
I have sworn 't.
Exeunt

No reckoning made, but sent to my account
O, fear me not.

If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
In what particular thought to work I know not;
My lord, from head to foot.
I find thee apt;
The head is not more native to the heart,
And I am sick at heart.
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
Nay, but swear't.
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
To make it truster of your own report
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
By laboursome petition, and at last
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
Give me one poor request.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!

Alas, poor ghost!

She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
My fate cries out,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
Not when I saw't.
Who hath relieved you?
It would have much amazed you.
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
But let me hear from you.
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
What I have said to you.
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
This marvel to you.
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
I'll visit you.
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
Arm'd, say you?
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
But I have that within which passeth show;
Not of that dye which their investments show,
Of these delated articles allow.
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
What hour now?
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
And it must follow, as the night the day,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,

For they are actions that a man might play:
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Look you, I'll go pray.
Say,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
See, it stalks away!
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
We have sworn, my lord, already.

All my smooth body.
And makes each petty artery in this body
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
What, look'd he frowningly?
Yes, 'faith heartily.
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
You do not understand yourself so clearly
Most constantly.
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
truepenny?
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And these few precepts in thy memory
Yea, from the table of my memory
That are so fortified against our story
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
From me, whose love was of that dignity
Passing through nature to eternity.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
And we did think it writ down in our duty
In that and all things will we show our duty.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO
Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS
My good lord--
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO
Where, my lord?
HAMLET
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET
Saw? who?
HORATIO
My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET
The king my father!
HORATIO
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
HAMLET
For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
HAMLET
But where was this?
MARCELLUS
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET
Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET
'Tis very strange.
HORATIO
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAMLET
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
We do, my lord.
HAMLET
Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET
From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET
What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET
Pale or red?
HORATIO
Nay, very pale.
HAMLET
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO
Most constantly.
HAMLET
I would I had been there.
HORATIO
It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Longer, longer.
HORATIO
Not when I saw't.
HAMLET
His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAMLET
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO
I warrant it will.
HAMLET
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
All
Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
LAERTES
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
No more but so?
LAERTES
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS

A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LORD POLONIUS
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.
OPHELIA
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
Farewell.
Exit

LORD POLONIUS
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
OPHELIA
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, well bethought:
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.
OPHELIA
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
LORD POLONIUS
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPHELIA
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
OPHELIA
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
OPHELIA
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
OPHELIA
I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The platform.
Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAMLET
What hour now?
HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET
No, it is struck.
HORATIO
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within

What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
HORATIO
Is it a custom?
HAMLET
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
HORATIO
Look, my lord, it comes!
Enter Ghost

HAMLET
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
MARCELLUS
Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
HORATIO
No, by no means.
HAMLET
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
HORATIO
Do not, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
HAMLET
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
MARCELLUS
You shall not go, my lord.
HAMLET
Hold off your hands.
HORATIO
Be ruled; you shall not go.
HAMLET
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination.
MARCELLUS
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
HORATIO
Have after. To what issue will this come?
MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HORATIO
Heaven will direct it.
MARCELLUS
Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Ghost
Mark me.
HAMLET
I will.
Ghost
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
HAMLET
Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
HAMLET
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Ghost
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET
What?
Ghost
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
HAMLET
O God!
Ghost
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
HAMLET
Murder!
Ghost
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
HAMLET
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
Ghost
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
HAMLET
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ghost
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Exit

HAMLET
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Writing

So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
I have sworn 't.
MARCELLUS HORATIO
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS
[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
HORATIO
[Within]	Heaven secure him!
HAMLET
So be it!
HORATIO
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HAMLET
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

MARCELLUS
How is't, my noble lord?
HORATIO
What news, my lord?
HAMLET
O, wonderful!
HORATIO
Good my lord, tell it.
HAMLET
No; you'll reveal it.
HORATIO
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord.
HAMLET
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
HORATIO MARCELLUS
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAMLET
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
HORATIO
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
HAMLET
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
HORATIO
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAMLET
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 'faith heartily.
HORATIO
There's no offence, my lord.
HAMLET
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
HORATIO
What is't, my lord? we will.
HAMLET
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HORATIO MARCELLUS
My lord, we will not.
HAMLET
Nay, but swear't.
HORATIO
In faith,
My lord, not I.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
HAMLET
Upon my sword.
MARCELLUS
We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAMLET
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
truepenny?
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.
HORATIO
Propose the oath, my lord.
HAMLET
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HORATIO
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HAMLET
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As
